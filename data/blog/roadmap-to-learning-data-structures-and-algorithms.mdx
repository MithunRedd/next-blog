### 1. Arrays

![Arrays](/images/roadmap-to-dsa/array.png)

Arrays are the simplest and most common data structures. They are characterised by the facile access of elements by index (position).

#### What are they used for?

Imagine having a theater chair row. Each chair has assigned a position (from left to right), therefore every spectator will have assigned the number from the chair (s)he will be sitting on. This is an array. Expand the problem to the whole theater (rows and columns of chairs) and you will have a 2D array (matrix)!

#### Properties

- Elements' values are placed in order and accessed by their index from 0 to the length of the array-1.
- An array is a continuous block of memory.
- They are usually made of elements of the same type (it depends on the programming language).
- Access and addition of elements are fast; search and deletion are not done in O(1).

### 2. Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear data structures, just like arrays. The main difference between linked lists and arrays is that elements of a linked list are not stored at contiguous memory locations. It is composed of nodes - entities that store the current element's value and an address reference to the next element. That way, elements are linked by pointers.

One relevant application of linked lists is the implementation of the previous and the next page of a browser. A double linked list is the perfect data structure to store the pages displayed by a user's search.

#### Properties

- They come in three types: singly, doubly and circular;
- Elements are NOT stored in a contiguous block of memory;
- Perfect for an excellent memory management (using pointers implies dynamic memory usage);
- Insertion and deletion are fast; accessing and searching elements are done in linear time.

### 3. Stacks

![Stacks](/images/roadmap-to-dsa/stacks.png)

A stack is an abstract data type that formalizes the concept of restricted access collection. The restriction follows the rule LIFO (Last In, First Out). Therefore, the last element added in the stack is the first element you remove from it.
Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

#### What are they used for?

The most common real-life example uses plates placed one over another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first to be removed. The plate placed at the bottommost is the one that remains in the stack for the longest period of time.
One situation when stacks are the most useful is when you need to obtain the reverse order of given elements. Just push them all in a stack and then pop them.
Another interesting application is the Valid Parentheses Problem. Given a string of parantheses, you can check that they are matched using a stack.

#### Properties

- You can only access the last element at one time (the one at the top);
- One disadvantage is that once you pop elements from the top in order to access other elements, their values will be lost from the stack's memory;
- Access of other elements is done in linear time; any other operation is in O(1).

### 4. Queues
